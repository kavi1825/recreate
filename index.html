	<h2><strong>Re: Eileen Dover University Application</strong></h2>

	<p>Dear Eileen,</p>
	<p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome’s  science 
		Faculty to study as part of your <u>PhD</u> next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.
	</p>

	<h2><strong>Starting dates</strong></h2>
	<p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of the semester, the start dates for each one  are as follows:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
		<li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
		<li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date would you prefer.</p>
	<p>
		You can find more information about <a href="http://www.sonatech.ac.in">important University dates</a> on our websites.
	</p>


	<h2><strong>Subjects of study </strong></h2>

	<p>At the Awesome Science Faculty ,we have a pretty open-minded research facility – as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology .You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we would like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted, we were more intrigued by our as follows, in order of priority:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Enter turning H<sub>2</sub>0 into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol(C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>).</li>
		<li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperature exceeding 30<sup>°</sup>C 86<sup>°</sup> F, when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 x 10<sup>4</sup>.).</li>
		<li><u>HTML</u> and <u>CSS</u> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>So please can you provide known information on each of these subjects, including how long you’d expects the results to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we’d need to know? Thanks.  </p>

	<h2><strong>Exotic dance moves</strong></h2>
	<p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I <i>did</i> study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, my favourite dances are as follows, with definition:</p>
	<p>Polynesian chicken dance</p>
	<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;A little known but <i>very</i> influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;whole village would dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;their livestock to be “fruitful”.</p>

	<p>Icelandic Brownian shuffle</p>
	<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;used to practice this dance, which involved  huddling close together in a &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;tiny, very &rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking.</p>

	<p>Arctic robot dance</p>
	<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;An interesting example of historic misinformation, English Explorers in &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;the 1960s believed to have discovered a new dance style characterised by  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“robotic”, stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;just moving like this because they were really cold.</p>

	<p>For more of my research, see my <a href="http://www.sonatech.ac.in">exotic dance research page</a>.<br><br>Yours sincerely,
